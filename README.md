This C# console application simulates an emergency response system where different units—
 such as police, firefighters, and ambulances—are dispatched to handle randomly generated 
incidents like crimes, fires, and medical emergencies. Designed as an educational project, it 
demonstrates key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including inheritance, 
polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. 
Key Features 
    • Dynamic Incident Generation: The system randomly creates emergencies at various 
      locations with different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard). 
    • Specialized Emergency Units: Each unit (Police, Firefighter, Ambulance, K9, Coast Guard) 
      responds uniquely based on the incident type. 
    • Automatic Dispatching: The correct unit is selected based on the emergency type (e.g., 
      firefighters handle fires, ambulances handle medical crises). 
    • Scoring System: Successfully managed incidents award +10 points, while unresolved 
      emergencies deduct -5 points. 
    • Clean Console Output: Displays clear, formatted logs of each response, including unit 
      actions and score updates.
